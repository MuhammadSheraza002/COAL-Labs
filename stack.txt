In assembly language programming, the stack segment typically defines the memory area used for the program's stack, and the size of the stack is determined by the .STACK directive. In your example, the stack segment is declared as .STACK 100h, which means the stack size is 256 bytes (100h in hexadecimal is 256 in decimal).

a. What is the hex contents of SP when the program begins?
The stack pointer (SP) is a register that points to the top of the stack. When a program begins, the SP is usually set to the highest memory address of the stack segment, which in this case would be the starting address of the stack segment. So, the initial value of SP would be 100h (in hexadecimal).

b. What is the maximum hex number of words that the stack may contain?
Since the stack size is 256 bytes, and each word typically consists of 2 bytes (16 bits), you can calculate the maximum number of words the stack can contain by dividing the stack size (in bytes) by the size of a word (in bytes):

Maximum number of words = Stack size (in bytes) / Size of a word (in bytes)

Maximum number of words = 256 bytes / 2 bytes/word = 128 words

So, the maximum number of words that the stack may contain is 128 words. In hexadecimal, this is 80h.



2.Suppose that AX= 1234h, BX= 5678h, CX = 9ABCh, and SP=
1 OOh.° Give the contents of AX, BX, CX, and SP after executing
the following instructions:
PUSH AX
PUSH BX
XCHG AX,CX
POP ex
PUSH AX •.
POP J BX


Let's go through the instructions one by one and update the values of AX, BX, CX, and SP after each instruction.

Initially:

AX = 1234h
BX = 5678h
CX = 9ABCh
SP = 100h
PUSH AX:

Push the value of AX onto the stack, and SP decreases by 2.
The value 1234h is pushed onto the stack, and SP becomes FEh.
AX remains 1234h.
BX and CX remain unchanged.
PUSH BX:

Push the value of BX onto the stack, and SP decreases by 2.
The value 5678h is pushed onto the stack, and SP becomes FCh.
AX remains 1234h.
BX remains 5678h.
CX remains unchanged.
XCHG AX, CX:

Exchange the values of AX and CX.
AX becomes 9ABCh, and CX becomes 1234h.
SP, BX, and the stack remain unchanged.
POP CX:

Pop a 16-bit value from the stack into CX, and SP increases by 2.
The value 1234h is popped from the stack into CX, and SP becomes FEh.
AX remains 9ABCh.
BX remains 5678h.
CX becomes 1234h.
PUSH AX:

Push the value of AX (9ABCh) onto the stack, and SP decreases by 2.
The value 9ABCh is pushed onto the stack, and SP becomes FCh.
AX remains 9ABCh.
BX remains 5678h.
CX remains 1234h.
POP BX:

Pop a 16-bit value from the stack into BX, and SP increases by 2.
The value 9ABCh is popped from the stack into BX, and SP becomes FEh.
AX remains 9ABCh.
BX becomes 9ABCh.
CX remains 1234h.
After executing all the instructions:

AX = 9ABCh
BX = 9ABCh
CX = 1234h
SP = FEh




3.When the stack has completely filled the stack area, SP = 0. If another
word is pu.shcd onto the stack, what would happen to SP?
What might happen 10 the program?

When the stack is completely filled, and you attempt to push another word onto the stack, it will result in a stack overflow. In your scenario, if SP = 0 when the stack is full, pushing another word will decrement the SP further.

As SP decreases, it may reach the lower bound of the stack segment (typically defined by the .STACK directive), which in your previous example was 100h (256 bytes). When SP goes below this lower limit (e.g., SP = -2, SP = -4, etc., in hexadecimal), it can lead to memory corruption, overwriting data or code in areas of memory outside the stack segment. This can result in unpredictable program behavior and may even cause the program to crash or malfunction.

In a typical scenario, it's essential to manage the stack size properly to avoid stack overflows. You should ensure that you don't push more data onto the stack than it can accommodate within its defined size, as exceeding the stack's limits can lead to unexpected and undesirable consequences in your program.


4.Suppose a program contains the lines
CALL PROCl
MOV AX,BX
and (a) instruction MOV AX,BX is stored at 08FD:0203h, (b) PROCI
Is a NEAR procedure that begins at 08FD:300h, (c) SP= OIOAh.
What are the contents of JP and SP just after CALL PROCl is executed?
What word is on top of the stack?

To determine the contents of IP and SP just after the CALL instruction is executed, we first need to understand the effect of a CALL instruction on the stack. When a CALL instruction is executed, it pushes the return address onto the stack. In this case, since the CALL instruction is CALL PROCl, the return address will be the address of the next instruction after the CALL. After pushing the return address onto the stack, the IP is set to the entry point of the called procedure (PROCl in this case).

Given the information provided:
(a) The instruction MOV AX, BX is stored at 08FD:0203h.
(b) PROCl is a NEAR procedure that begins at 08FD:300h.
(c) SP = 010Ah.

Let's break down the steps:

The CALL instruction is executed at address 08FD:0203h. This means the return address will be 08FD:0205h, which is the address of the next instruction.

The return address (08FD:0205h) is pushed onto the stack. Since the stack grows downward, the SP will decrease by 2, and the value at SP will become 08FD:0205h.

The IP is set to the entry point of the called procedure, which is 08FD:0300h (PROCl).

After the CALL instruction, the contents of IP and SP are as follows:

IP = 08FD:0300h (the entry point of the called procedure)
SP = 08FD:0205h (the return address pushed onto the stack)
The word on top of the stack is 08FD:0205h, which is the return address.



5.Suppose SP= 0200h, top of stack = 012Ah. What are the contents
Of JP and SP
a. after RET is executed, where RET appears in a NEAR procedure?
b. after RET 4 is executed, where RET ap~;m in a NEAR procc_dure'


Let's examine the contents of IP and SP after the execution of RET instructions in both scenarios:

Given:

SP = 0200h
Top of stack = 012Ah
a. After RET is executed (where RET appears in a NEAR procedure):

The RET instruction, when executed, pops the return address from the stack and sets IP to that address.
The top of the stack (value 012Ah) is popped, and SP is incremented by 2.
IP is set to the popped value (012Ah).
After the RET instruction is executed:

IP = 012Ah
SP = 0202h (SP was incremented by 2)
b. After RET 4 is executed (where RET appears in a NEAR procedure):

The RET instruction, when followed by a numerical value (RET 4), pops the return address from the stack, adds the specified value to SP, and sets IP to the popped address.
The top of the stack (value 012Ah) is popped, SP is incremented by 4, and IP is set to the popped value (012Ah).
After the RET 4 instruction is executed:

IP = 012Ah
SP = 0204h (SP was incremented by 4)
In both scenarios, the IP is set to 012Ah, which is the return address from the stack. The difference lies in the change to SP: in the first scenario (a), SP is incremented by 2, and in the second scenario (b), SP is incremented by 4.



Write some code to
a. place the top of the stack into AX, without changing tilt!
stackcontents. • •
- b. place the word that is below the stack top into ex. without
changing the stack contents. You may use AX.
c. exchange the top two words on the stack. You may use AX
and B.X.. · ' .



Here's a simple x86 assembly code for each of your requirements using the stack operations:

a. To place the top of the stack into AX without changing the stack contents:

assembly
Copy code
POP AX ; Pop the top of the stack into AX
PUSH AX ; Push the value back onto the stack (optional, if you want to keep the stack unchanged)
b. To place the word that is below the stack top into CX without changing the stack contents:

assembly
Copy code
POP AX      ; Pop the top of the stack into AX
POP CX      ; Pop the word below the top into CX
PUSH AX     ; Push the value back onto the stack (optional, to keep the stack unchanged)
PUSH CX     ; Push the word you popped earlier back onto the stack (optional, to keep the stack unchanged)
c. To exchange the top two words on the stack using AX and BX:

assembly
Copy code
POP AX      ; Pop the top of the stack into AX
POP BX      ; Pop the second word into BX
PUSH AX     ; Push AX (originally the top) back onto the stack, now as the second element
PUSH BX     ; Push BX (originally the second) back onto the stack, now as the top
Please note that these instructions assume a little-endian stack architecture where the top of the stack is the lowest memory address. You can adjust them if your architecture is big-endian. Also, you may need to consider stack boundary conditions to ensure that these operations are safe.



6.·Procedures arc supposed to return the stack to the .:alling program
in the same condition that they received it. However, it
may be !lseful to have procedures that alter the stack. For example,
suppose we would like to write a NEAR p_roccdure
SAVE_REGS that saves BX,CX,DX,Sl,Dl,BP,DS, and ES on the
stack. After pushing these. registers, the stack would look like this:
ES ·content
DX cont.,nt
ex content
BX content
return address (offset)
Now, unfortunately, SAVE_REGS can't return to the calling program,
because the return address is not at the top of the stack.
a. Devise a way to implement a proce<lurt! SAVE_REGS that gets
around this problem (you may use AX to do this).
b. Write a procedure RESTORE_REGS that restores the registers
th.at SAVE_REGS has saved.


You can implement the SAVE_REGS procedure to save the registers and still allow the calling program to return by using an additional register to temporarily store the return address. You can follow these steps:

a. Implement SAVE_REGS:

assembly
Copy code
SAVE_REGS PROC
    PUSH AX         ; Save AX temporarily
    PUSH BX
    PUSH CX
    PUSH DX
    PUSH SI
    PUSH DI
    PUSH BP
    PUSH DS
    PUSH ES

    ; Store the return address in AX
    MOV AX, [BP + 4]

    ; Push the return address onto the stack
    PUSH AX

    ; Restore AX and return
    POP AX
    RET
SAVE_REGS ENDP
In this implementation, before saving the registers, we temporarily store the return address in AX. Then, we push the return address onto the stack, ensuring that the stack is in the expected state for the calling program.

b. Implement RESTORE_REGS to restore the saved registers:

assembly
Copy code
RESTORE_REGS PROC
    POP AX          ; Pop the return address
    POP ES
    POP DS
    POP BP
    POP DI
    POP SI
    POP DX
    POP CX
    POP BX
    POP AX          ; Restore AX
    RET
RESTORE_REGS ENDP
In this procedure, we first pop the return address from the stack. Then, we pop the registers in reverse order, just as they were pushed by SAVE_REGS. Finally, we restore AX and return.

With these two procedures, you can use SAVE_REGS to save registers and RESTORE_REGS to restore them, ensuring that the stack is in the same condition as before when control returns to the calling program.




You can implement the SAVE_REGS procedure to save the registers and still allow the calling program to return by using an additional register to temporarily store the return address. You can follow these steps:

a. Implement SAVE_REGS:

assembly
Copy code
SAVE_REGS PROC
    PUSH AX         ; Save AX temporarily
    PUSH BX
    PUSH CX
    PUSH DX
    PUSH SI
    PUSH DI
    PUSH BP
    PUSH DS
    PUSH ES

    ; Store the return address in AX
    MOV AX, [BP + 4]

    ; Push the return address onto the stack
    PUSH AX

    ; Restore AX and return
    POP AX
    RET
SAVE_REGS ENDP
In this implementation, before saving the registers, we temporarily store the return address in AX. Then, we push the return address onto the stack, ensuring that the stack is in the expected state for the calling program.

b. Implement RESTORE_REGS to restore the saved registers:

assembly
Copy code
RESTORE_REGS PROC
    POP AX          ; Pop the return address
    POP ES
    POP DS
    POP BP
    POP DI
    POP SI
    POP DX
    POP CX
    POP BX
    POP AX          ; Restore AX
    RET
RESTORE_REGS ENDP
In this procedure, we first pop the return address from the stack. Then, we pop the registers in reverse order, just as they were pushed by SAVE_REGS. Finally, we restore AX and return.

With these two procedures, you can use SAVE_REGS to save registers and RESTORE_REGS to restore them, ensuring that the stack is in the same condition as before when control returns to the calling program.
